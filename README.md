# TinyBitNet - A C++ reimplementation of transformer with BitNet layers.

TinyBit is a minimal transformer architecture implementation built from scratch in C++. This project provides a clean, educational implementation of core transformer components using the Eigen library for efficient matrix computations.


## Dependencies

- **C++17** or later
- **[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)** (v3.3+) for matrix computations
- **CMake** (v3.10+) for build configuration
